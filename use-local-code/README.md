# hellofly
A minimal Go/Gin/CI application for tutorials

i originally had a fly.toml and exe in here that worked...
i want to create another version and sort out how to add
the appropriate gitignore stuff for this directory...


# hellofly
A minimal Go/Gin application for tutorials

docker build -t hellofly .   ==> builds the image locally...
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t hellofly   ==> runs it...

connect to http://localhost:8080/to/me for the message...

ps - port-8080 is open everywhere now, so could use:
-p 127.0.0.1:8181:8080 to only expose localhost-internal-8181...
--publish local:remote-docker is what happens with -p...
