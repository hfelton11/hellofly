this Dockerfile is minimal and uses the flyio-preset-program...
thus, you need to goto fly.io and get the flyctl program for yourself...

once you have flyctl - then just run: flyctl init
thus youll get a fly.toml (with default preselect name)...

my local-account-version is NOT in this .git-ignore file, but
you will probably want to put it in there so that people wont
do not deploy their-version on top of your-version...
